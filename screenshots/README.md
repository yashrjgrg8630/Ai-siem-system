# 📸 Project Screenshots

This folder contains screenshots of the **AI-Driven SIEM System** demonstrating real-time security monitoring, attack detection, and analytical insights.

The screenshots included showcase the following system features:

- **Real-Time Dashboard Overview**  
  Displays total logs, detected attacks, high-severity incidents, and unique source IPs in real time.

- **Live Log Monitoring Panel**  
  Continuously updated security logs with timestamp, source IP, port, detected attack type, and severity level.

- **DDoS Attack Detection View**  
  Visualization of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks with multiple source IPs, high severity alerts, and attack timelines.

- **Port Scanning Detection View**  
  Detection of port scanning activity across multiple ports, categorized with medium severity and summarized analytics.

- **Brute Force Attack Detection View**  
  Identification of repeated login attempts from malicious IPs, classified as brute force attacks with severity tagging.

- **Normal Traffic Monitoring**  
  Logs representing benign network activity with low severity, confirming normal system behavior.

- **Analytical Visualizations**  
  Charts displaying attack timelines and top attacking IP addresses to support security analysis and threat assessment.

These screenshots are referenced in the main project README to visually demonstrate the functionality, effectiveness, and real-time capabilities of the AI-based SIEM system.
