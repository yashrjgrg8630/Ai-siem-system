🔐 AI-Driven SIEM System

An AI-enabled Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system designed to simulate how modern security operations centers monitor logs, detect threats, and respond to cyber incidents in near real time using machine learning techniques.

📌 Project Description

This project provides a practical demonstration of a simplified SIEM platform by replicating core security workflows such as:

Continuous system log generation

Identification of suspicious and malicious activity

Machine-learning-based attack classification

Risk and severity assessment
# 🔐 AI-Driven SIEM System

An AI-enabled **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** system designed to simulate how modern Security Operations Centers (SOCs) monitor logs, detect threats, and respond to cyber incidents in near real time using machine learning techniques.

## 📌 Project Description

This project provides a practical demonstration of a simplified SIEM platform by replicating core security workflows such as:

- Continuous system log generation  
- Identification of suspicious and malicious activity  
- Machine-learning-based attack classification  
- Risk and severity assessment  
- Real-time visualization and alerting  

---

## 🚀 Core Capabilities

- Real-time log generation at fixed intervals  
- Detection of common attack patterns, including:
  - DDoS attacks  
  - Port scanning  
  - Brute-force login attempts  
- Automated severity scoring (**Low, Medium, High**)  
- Web-based interactive dashboard for monitoring  
- Advanced filtering and search by IP address and attack category  
- Analytical insights such as attack timelines and top threat sources  
- Simulated email alerts for high-severity security events  

---

## 🧠 System Architecture

The system follows a **modular architecture**, where the following components work together to simulate a real-world SIEM pipeline:

- Log generation module  
- Threat detection engine  
- Machine learning classification models  
- Visualization and alerting dashboard  

Each component operates independently while sharing data through well-defined interfaces.

- Overview dashboard for system status  
- Live log monitoring panel  
- Attack filtering by type  
- Search functionality based on source IP address  
- Analytics section for trends and attacker insights  
- High-risk alert simulation via email notifications
